When caused by bacteria, it is called bacterial gastroenteritis. The condition can affect adults and children. Symptoms of bacterial gastroenteritis can range from mild to severe and vary depending on the type of bacteria that have caused the infection. The main symptom is usually diarrhea. Other symptoms may include: Bacterial stomach flu can be caused by a number of different types of bacteria, which are most often spread through contaminated food and beverages. Depending on the source of infection, a large group of people may develop symptoms of bacterial gastroenteritis, or food poisoning, at the same time.

The surgery to remove a hydrocele (hydrocelectomy) can be done under general or regional anesthesia. An incision is made in the scrotum or lower abdomen to remove the hydrocele. If a hydrocele is found during surgery to repair an inguinal hernia, the surgeon might remove the hydrocele even if it's causing no discomfort.

        "treatment": {
            "outline": "Low blood pressure that either doesn't cause signs or symptoms or causes only mild symptoms rarely requires treatment. If you have symptoms, treatment depends on the cause. For instance, when medication causes low blood pressure, treatment usually involves changing or stopping the medication or lowering the dose. If it's not clear what's causing low blood pressure or no treatment exists, the goal is to raise your blood pressure and reduce signs and symptoms. Depending on your age, health and the type of low blood pressure you have, you can do this in several ways: Use more salt. Experts usually recommend limiting salt in your diet because sodium can raise blood pressure, sometimes dramatically. For people with low blood pressure, that can be a good thing. But because excess sodium can lead to heart failure, especially in older adults, it's important to check with your doctor before increasing the salt in your diet. Drink more water. Fluids increase blood volume and help prevent dehydration, both of which are important in treating hypotension. Wear compression stockings. The elastic stockings commonly used to relieve the pain and swelling of varicose veins can help reduce the pooling of blood in your legs. Some people tolerate elastic abdominal binders better than they do compression stockings. Medications. Several medications can be used to treat low blood pressure that occurs when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). For example, the drug fludrocortisone, which boosts your blood volume, is often used to treat this form of low blood pressure. Doctors often use the drug midodrine (Orvaten) to raise standing blood pressure levels in people with chronic orthostatic hypotension. It works by restricting the ability of your blood vessels to expand, which raises blood pressure.",

But because they're hard to clean, they may be more vulnerable to tooth decay and gum disease than other teeth are.

        "overview": "Influenza infection, also known as the flu, is a common viral infection of the airways that most often occurs in fall and winter. It can cause multiple symptoms, including fever, cough, a runny nose and muscle aches. Influenza can be caused by a number of different viruses and is spread from person to person, primarily through sneezing and coughing. When an infected person sneezes, coughs or talks, they may send infected water droplets into the air. It is then possible for a nearby person to inhale these and contract the infection themselves. It is also possible to catch influenza indirectly by touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth. Because influenza is so infectious, people with mild cases of the flu are recommended to avoid contact with others by staying at home during their illness. In most cases, no specific treatment is needed, and people recover from flu within a week. However, people with severe cases of the infection, or who are at higher risk of developing flu-related complications, may need to seek medical attention. In rare instances, influenza can cause severe complications, in which case the condition may become life-threatening.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "There is no specific medicine used to target the influenza virus itself. Instead, treatment aims to manage and ease the symptoms of influenza, until the body's natural immune system is able to clear the infection. Most people are able to recover from influenza infection at home, without the need for medical intervention. Home remedies that may help manage the symptoms of influenza include: Staying hydrated by drinking lots of fluids, such as water Resting and avoiding strenuous activities Reducing fever and aches with acetaminophen, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen Reducing cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose and sore throat, with common cold treatment methods such as nasal decongestants and oral lozenges Good to know: Although aspirin can be used to reduce fever and aches, it is not recommended for use by children or adolescents under the age of 18. This is because of the risk of a rare but serious condition called Reyes syndrome, which can result in liver and brain damage. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are generally used as suitable alternatives. People with a severe case of the flu, or those who are at greater risk of developing complications, may be prescribed antiviral medications by their doctor. People who are at high risk of developing complications may also be prescribed antiviral medication as a preventive measure, in order to reduce the risk of contracting the flu altogether. The most common antiviral medications used are: Oseltamivir, typically swallowed as a pill or liquid Zanamivir, typically inhaled as a powder Peramivir, typically injected as a liquid These medications target both influenza type A and type B. They do not kill the virus, but they can lessen the symptoms and shorten the period of illness by a couple of days. Antiviral drugs are also used to reduce the risk of the affected person developing complications. These drugs are most effective when used within the first 48 hours of symptoms first appearing. Good to know: Because influenza infection is viral and not bacterial, antibiotics are not effective in treating the illness. However, antibiotics may be prescribed if the affected person develops an additional bacterial infection as a complication of influenza.",

This condition mostly affects older men. The most common symptom of an inguinal hernia is a lump in the groin area, which may go away temporarily when pushed on. The diagnosis is made by a doctor examining the lump and examining the lump with an ultrasound scan of the area. As untreated hernias can sometimes cause bowel to become trapped and die, the hole in the abdominal wall is often repaired surgically. A trapped hernia is an emergency and needs urgent treatment. Surgical treatment usually works well to cure this condition.",

        "treatment": {
            "outline": "There are several options for relieving intercostal neuralgia, and many people find that a combination of treatments works best. Some over-the-counter topical treatments can provide temporary pain relief. These include: capsaicin creams or skin patches lidocaine gels or skin patches. Antidepressants are sometimes used to treat nerve-related pain. Common ones include: amitriptyline desipramine (Norpramin) duloxetine (Cymbalta) imipramine (Tofranil) nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor) venlafaxine Your doctor might also have you try an anticonvulsant medication, such as: carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Epitol, Equetro, Tegretol) gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin, Horizant) oxcarbazepine (Oxtellar, Trileptal) pregabalin (Lyrica). In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe an opioid-aspirin or opioid-acetaminophen to help with the pain. These are all powerful medications with many side effects, so they're usually a last-resort option. An intercostal nerve block is an injection that combines a local anesthetic with corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Your doctor will use an X-ray to guide the injection into the area just under your rib cage. While it can take a few days to start working, intercostal nerve blocks can last for several months. Your doctor can also give you a thoracic epidural injection, which involves injecting anti-inflammatory medication into the area around your spinal cord. You can also try pulsed radiofrequency, a minimally invasive procedure that uses an electrode needle to provide short-term pain relief. Other possible treatment options include: physical or occupational therapy cognitive and behavioral therapy relaxation therapy. Regardless of the treatment options you choose, try to remain as physically active as possible to keep your muscles strong and healthy.",

        "overview": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder affecting bowel function, characterized by symptoms mostly relating to digestive discomfort, including diarrhea, constipation, bloating, gas, cramping, and abdominal pain. IBS affects around 11 % of the population globally. In western countries, such as the U.S., women are significantly more likely to be affected by IBS than men, but this ratio varies dramatically around the world; in India, for example, between 80 and 90 percent of those affected are male. People who have a family history of irritable bowel syndrome are more likely to develop the condition than those who do not. Different people will experience different combinations of the possible symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), thus requiring varying treatments. Diagnosis of IBS will involve identifying triggers of its symptoms, which are usually gastrointestinal and related to a persons diet and lifestyle, so that a persons exposure to triggers that activate irritable bowel syndrome can be minimised as part of their treatment plan. IBS can be a long-term condition requiring careful management. The improvement of a persons digestive health is often brought about by a combination of lifestyle and diet changes designed to reduce instances of bloating, constipation, diarrhea and other symptoms they may be experiencing. Changes to a persons diet may involve adopting a low FODMAP diet; a diet low in fermentable short-chain carbohydrates. Irritable bowel syndrome does not cause inflammation or permanent damage such as bleeding or ulcers, nor an increased risk of cancers.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "Treatments for IBS include: Lifestyle changes addressing diet or stress are usually the first approach to IBS treatment. Addressing generalized stress and anxiety is a common treatment approach. Some people experience anxiety around their IBS symptoms (known as GI symptom-specific anxiety), and may limit their exposure to activities and situations that would be affected by their IBS. This can increase their anxiety, creating a vicious cycle that increases their symptoms. Therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, relaxation therapy, biofeedback and hypnotherapy may be used to help individuals both manage general stress and break this cycle. Self-care to manage stress is another option, with common techniques including meditation, yoga and exercise. Each person has different dietary triggers for IBS. If sensitivity to specific foods is a trigger for IBS symptoms, treatment may include reducing or eliminating these foods from the diet. Many people find it helpful to avoid high-FODMAP foods; FODMAP stands for: Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And polyols; fermentable short-chain carbohydrates which are prevalent in a regular diet, which the small intestine does not absorb very well. Examples of low FODMAP foods which may ease symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome when included in a persons diet include: Lactose-free or low-lactose dairy products, such as non-dairy milks, hard cheeses such as cheddar Low-fructose fruits such as oranges, kiwis and strawberries Low-fructan vegetables such as bean sprouts, carrots, eggplant, potatoes, olives, turnips Protein such as lean meat and tofu Gluten-free grains. Examples of high FODMAP foods, which may aggravate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and should be excluded from ones diet where possible, include: Lactose; cows milk, yoghurt, and cream Fructose; fruits and products high in natural sugars from fruit, such as apples, pears, peaches, corn syrup Fructans; vegetables and grains high in fructans include artichokes, garlic, onions, broccoli, beetroot and grains such as wheat and rye Polyols; sweeteners such as sorbitol and xylitol, found in sugar-free productsAnother approach to alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by changing ones diet is to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Eating more slowly can reduce gas and bloating. Along with an individuals possible food intolerances, foods commonly associated with abdominal cramping or diarrhea include coffee, caffeine, alcohol or high-fat foods, as well as poorly-digested sugars, such as sorbitol or fructose. Beans, raisins or breads can cause gas, and lactose intolerance can trigger IBS symptoms. Eating a high-fiber diet can improve stool quality and keep the GI tract healthy, but a diet excessively high in fiber can also cause gas and diarrhea.",

Joint pain refers to discomfort, aches, and soreness in any of the body's joints. Joint pain is a common complaint. It doesn't typically require a hospital visit. Sometimes, joint pain is the result of an illness or injury. Arthritis is also a common cause of joint pain. However, it can also be due to other conditions or factors.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "Doctors consider both OA and RA to be chronic conditions. There's no treatment currently available that will completely eliminate the joint pain associated with arthritis or keep it from returning. However, there are ways to manage the pain: It may help to use topical pain relievers or take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. Stay physically active and follow a fitness program focusing on moderate exercise. Stretch before exercising to maintain a good range of motion in your joints. Keep your body weight within a healthy range. This will lessen stress on the joints. If your pain isn't due to arthritis, you can try taking a nonprescription, anti-inflammatory drug, getting a massage, taking a warm bath, stretching frequently, and getting adequate rest. Your treatment options will depend on the cause of the pain. In some cases, your doctor will need to draw out accumulated fluid in the joint area to test for infection or gout or other causes of the joint pain. They might also recommend surgery to replace the joint. Other nonsurgical treatment methods could include lifestyle changes or medications that can potentially cause your RA to go into remission. In the case of RA, your doctor will first address inflammation. Once the RA goes into remission, your medical treatment will focus on keeping a tight rein on your condition so that you avoid flare-ups.",

Laryngitis which lasts longer than three weeks is called chronic laryngitis. Laryngitis can affect people of every age and gender. The main symptoms of laryngitis are a hoarse voice, also known as dysphonia, and sore throat, due to inflammation in the laryngeal area. Acute laryngitis may have infectious or non-infectious causes, including overuse of the voice which puts a strain on the vocal cords, or gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD); laryngitis caused by GERD is called reflux laryngitis. Treatment for laryngitis may include resting the voice, simple pain relief, and home remedies such as drinking warm liquids to soothe the throat. If laryngeal discomfort and other symptoms are still present after three weeks, antibiotics may be prescribed, if the cause is diagnosed to be a bacterial infection. An antifungal medication may be prescribed if the cause is a fungal infection. Most people recover from acute laryngitis within three weeks, and do not go on to develop chronic laryngitis.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "Treatment depends on the source of the problem, but mainly involves resting the larynx, by not overusing the voice while hoarseness is present. Drinking warm liquids and using medicated throat lozenges may be useful to soothe the throat. Home remedies such as adding ginger or tumeric to warm drinks can help fight causal infections. Simple pain medications (ibuprofen or paracetamol) can help with the pain. If the condition is caused by bacteria, the treatment may involve antibiotics.",

Bed rest isn't recommended. Continue your activities as much as you can tolerate. Try light activity, such as walking and activities of daily living. Stop activity that increases pain, but don't avoid activity out of fear of pain.

        "overview": "A deviated septum occurs when the thin wall (nasal septum) between your nasal passages is displaced to one side. In many people, the nasal septum is off-center - or deviated - making one nasal passage smaller. When a deviated septum is severe, it can block one side of your nose and reduce airflow, causing difficulty breathing. The additional exposure of a deviated septum to the drying effect of airflow through the nose may sometimes contribute to crusting or bleeding in certain people. A nasal blockage or congestion (obstruction) can occur from a deviated nasal septum, from swelling of the tissues lining the nose or from both. Treatment of nasal obstruction may include medications to reduce the swelling or nasal dilators that help open the nasal passages. You'll need surgery to correct a deviated septum.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "MInitial treatment of a deviated septum may be directed at managing your symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe: Decongestants. Decongestants are medications that reduce nasal tissue swelling, helping to keep the airways on both sides of your nose open. Decongestants are available as a pill or as a nasal spray. But use nasal sprays with caution. Frequent and continued use can create dependency and cause symptoms to be worse (rebound) after you stop using them. Oral decongestants have a stimulant effect and may cause you to be jittery as well as make your blood pressure and heart rate go up. Antihistamines. Antihistamines are medications that help prevent allergy symptoms, including a stuffy or runny nose. They can also sometimes help nonallergic conditions such as those occurring with a cold. Some antihistamines cause drowsiness and can affect your ability to perform tasks that require physical coordination, such as driving. Nasal steroid sprays. Prescription nasal corticosteroid sprays can reduce swelling in your nasal passage and help with drainage. It usually takes from one to three weeks for steroid sprays to reach their maximal effect, so it is important to follow your doctor's directions in using them. Medications only treat the swollen mucous membranes and won't correct a deviated septum. Surgical repair (septoplasty) If you still experience symptoms despite medical therapy, you may consider surgery to correct your deviated septum (septoplasty). Septoplasty is the usual way to repair a deviated septum. During septoplasty, your nasal septum is straightened and repositioned in the center of your nose. This may require your surgeon to cut and remove parts of your septum before reinserting them in the proper position. The level of improvement you can expect with surgery depends on the severity of your deviation. Symptoms due to the deviated septum - particularly nasal obstruction - could completely go away. However, any other nasal or sinus conditions you have that affect the tissues lining your nose - such as allergies - can't be cured with only surgery. In some cases, surgery to reshape the nose (rhinoplasty) is performed at the same time as septoplasty. Rhinoplasty involves modifying the bone and cartilage of your nose to change its shape or size or both.",

Inflammation of the inside of the nose causes swelling, blockage and the production of more fluid than usual. There are multiple possible causes, but the most common is a viral infection. Besides a blocked and runny nose, symptoms may include face pain and sneezing. Some people may find their symptoms only last a number of days, others may find their symptoms persist for weeks or months. Treatment depends on the cause, but many people find that the symptoms are helped by breathing warm, humid air, using decongestant sprays and taking anti-inflammatory medications. In most cases, the symptoms will get better without specific treatment. If there is a known cause, this should be treated or avoided. Most people will have no further problems as a result of non-allergic rhinitis.",

        "overview": "Onychomycosis (also known as tinea unguium) is a fungal nail infection which can affect the toenails and/or fingernails and which occurs in about 10 percent of adults in the United States. Onychomycosis more commonly affects toenails rather than fingernails. There are several different types of fungal nail infection, depending on the kind of fungus causing the infection. Onychomycosis or infected nails are most often caused by a type of parasitic fungi called dermatophyte fungi. Most types of onychomycosis have the same signs of infection: the infected nail usually becomes thick and discoloured. This process generally starts at the tip of the nail and progresses downwards towards the root. As the infection progresses, the affected nail can become itchy and/or slightly painful. Infected nails may become crumbly, and it is not uncommon for part or all of the infected nail to break off. Treatment usually involves keeping the nail clean and taking a course of topical antifungal (antimycotic) medication.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "Fungal nail infections do not go away on their own, so a course of treatment is always required. This usually involves a combined approach of keeping the affected nails clean to reduce irritation and inflammation, at the same time as following a course of antifungal medication. Onychomycosis is highly infectious, so it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible to minimise the risk of passing the infection to others. There are various precautions that one can take in order to reduce the risk of spreading fungal nail infections to others and to increase the chances of a quick recovery. To look after ones nails and prevent the spread of infection, it is recommended that one: Change ones socks and shoes regularly Dries ones hands and feet as soon as possible after exposure to water Files ones nails to keep the edges smooth Moisturise ones hands, nails and cuticles daily and after contact with liquids Select shoes and socks made of natural materials, such as cotton Treat skin infections like athletes foot promptly to avoid the infection reaching the nails Trim ones nails regularly Use separate scissors or clippers to tend to infected nails Wear clean, comfortable shoes Wear gloves for housework and other manual tasks Medications In addition to keeping the site of the infection clean, someone affected by a fungal nail infection may be prescribed topical antimycotics, i.e.antifungal products to apply to the affected area. Topical medications are currently the first-line treatment for fungal nail infections.Topical medications used to treat fungal nail infections These include: Amorolfine nail lacquer Tioconazole nail solution Ciclopirox Always use topical antifungal products according to a doctors advice and/or follow the guidelines on the packet. In some cases, all or part of the infected nail may be removed, in order to give the topical medications the best chance to work. This treatment is usually recommended for severe or persistent nail infections. It can be carried out during a regular appointment at the doctors office. If the nail is removed surgically, a local anaesthetic will be applied to the affected area before the infected part of the nail is removed. An advantage of surgical removal is that it can be carried out in one appointment, and the course of topical antimycotic medication can then be started. Alternatively, a dressing containing urea can be applied to the affected nail. This must be kept dry for 10 days, during which time the urea will soften the nail, so that it can be removed painlessly by the doctor during a follow-up appointment. After the nail is removed, topical medications can then be applied. The infection is considered to have cleared up when the new, healthy nail starts to show visible regrowth in the nail bed.",

        "overview": "Otitis externa is a condition that occurs when the external ear canal, the channel between the outer ear and the eardrum, becomes inflamed. The condition is typically the result of a bacterial or fungal infection, but can also be caused by irritation or allergies. As repeated exposure to water can make otitis externa more likely, the condition is commonly referred to as swimmers ear. Symptoms include pain in the ear, itchiness in the ear canal, partial hearing loss and a discharge of pus or liquid. While it can cause severe discomfort, most cases of otitis externa resolve in under a week. While ear drops are the most common treatment method, other options are also available for severe cases or when the condition is chronic or recurrent. Otitis externa should not be confused with the most common type of ear infection, otitis media. Also known as a middle ear infection, otitis media affects the air-filled cavity behind the eardrum. There are three main sub-varieties of otitis externa, each defined by the length of time the condition is experienced:Acute otitis externa is the most common form of the condition.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "People displaying symptoms of otitis media should consult a doctor. Treatment is aimed at relieving any pain, reducing inflammation and preventing the condition from recurring. The exact course that treatment will take, however, depends on the conditions severity, as well as whether it is acute, chronic or recurrent in nature. Before treatment is begun, the ear canal of the affected person may require cleaning. This helps to clear the residual discharge, allowing the treatment to be more effective. The method used to clean the ear canal will depend on the severity of the condition, but will typically involve swabbing, suction or the use of a syringe. Some of the most common treatment methods for otitis externa include: Ear drops Although ear drops can be bought over-the-counter, stronger, antibiotic and steroid containing ear drops may be prescribed by a doctor. The antibiotic is able to fight the infection, while the steroid element is designed to control the inflammation. Typically, ear drops will take around a week to clear the symptoms. If this does not happen, the doctor may prescribe a different type of ear drops. Alternatives to antibiotic medications may be prescribed. If it is suspected that the condition is being caused by overuse of antibiotics, or a skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis, steroid-only ear drops may be preferred. If a fungal infection is the cause, antifungal ear drops will likely be prescribed. It is important for the ear drops to be administered correctly for them to work effectively. To use ear drops, the affected person should: Lie on their side, with the affected ear pointing upwards Place the ear drops into the ear canal and remain in the same position for roughly 10 minutes Press down on the cartilage on the front of the ear to ensure the ear drops have entered the ear canal If the ear canal is severely swollen or blocked, an ear wick may be required to administer the drops. This involves inserting a medication-soaked gauze into the ear canal, ensuring the drops are able to make contact with the affected area and work effectively. The gauze will typically need to be changed every two to three days. Before beginning the use of ear drops, be sure to read the instructions contained within the packaging. If the drops contain antibiotics, it is also important to finish the prescribed course, even if the condition clears before this time. This prevents your body from building up an immunity. Oral antibiotics will only be prescribed in particularly severe cases, or if there is a risk of the infection spreading outside of the ear canal. This may be in addition to ear drops. It is important to read the instructions enclosed within the packaging carefully and to complete the whole course, even if symptoms disappear before this time. In particularly severe cases, a doctor may refer the affected person to an ear, nose and throat specialist, an otolaryngologist, for specialist treatment. This may also be the case if an episode of otitis externa does not respond to treatment, or if a person is experiencing the recurrent or chronic forms of the condition. If it is a mild case, the doctor may recommend treating the condition at home before prescribing any specific medication. This may involve the use of over-the-counter ear drops or sprays, as well as painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Placing a warm towel against the affected ear may also help to reduce pain.Keeping the affected ear dry is also important in helping the symptoms to clear. Take care while in the shower or bath, and refrain from swimming completely. Water, especially dirty water, tends to exacerbate the condition.",

Most adults in the UK have gum disease to some degree, and most people experience it at least once. It's much less common in children. If you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis. If gingivitis is not treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects the tissues that support teeth and hold them in place. If periodontitis is not treated, the bone in your jaw may be damaged and small spaces can open up between the gum and teeth. Your teeth can become loose and may eventually fall out.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "Treatment may be performed by a periodontist, a dentist or a dental hygienist. The goal of periodontitis treatment is to thoroughly clean the pockets around teeth and prevent damage to surrounding bone. You have the best chance for successful treatment when you also adopt a daily routine of good oral care, manage health conditions that may impact dental health and stop tobacco use.",

This condition is very common, and affects the majority of menstruating women in one way or another. These changes include a low mood, increased appetite, tender breasts, mood changes, irritability and acne. The severity of symptoms varies from person to person. These symptoms tend to repeat in a predictable pattern before a period. Treatment involves lifestyle changes and medications which help to manage the menstrual cycle. Although PMS cannot be cured, the symptoms can usually be well managed.",

            "outline": "The treatment involves managing the symptoms. This may be achieved by making lifestyle changes or with medications. Regular exercise, having a good support network and learning relaxation techniques may be helpful in reducing symptoms. Some medications are helpful, including the (oral contraceptive) pill, and low dose anti-depressant medications. In severe cases, surgical removal of the ovaries may be an option. This causes infertility, so it is most appropriate for women who are not planning to become pregnant.",

        "overview": "A tooth abscess is a pocket of pus that's caused by a bacterial infection. The abscess can occur at different regions of the tooth for different reasons. A periapical (per-e-AP-ih-kul) abscess occurs at the tip of the root, whereas a periodontal (per-e-o-DON-tul) abscess occurs in the gums at the side of a tooth root. The information here refers specifically to periapical abscesses. A periapical tooth abscess usually occurs as a result of an untreated dental cavity, an injury or prior dental work. Dentists will treat a tooth abscess by draining it and getting rid of the infection. They may be able to save your tooth with a root canal treatment, but in some cases the tooth may need to be pulled. Leaving a tooth abscess untreated can lead to serious, even life-threatening, complications.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "The goal of treatment is to get rid of the infection. To accomplish this, your dentist may: Open up (incise) and drain the abscess. The dentist will make a small cut into the abscess, allowing the pus to drain out, and then wash the area with salt water (saline). Occasionally, a small rubber drain is placed to keep the area open for drainage while the swelling decreases. Perform a root canal. This can help eliminate the infection and save your tooth. To do this, your dentist drills down into your tooth, removes the diseased central tissue (pulp) and drains the abscess. He or she then fills and seals the tooth's pulp chamber and root canals. The tooth may be capped with a crown to make it stronger, especially if this is a back tooth. If you care for your restored tooth properly, it can last a lifetime. Pull the affected tooth. If the affected tooth can't be saved, your dentist will pull (extract) the tooth and drain the abscess to get rid of the infection. Prescribe antibiotics. If the infection is limited to the abscessed area, you may not need antibiotics. But if the infection has spread to nearby teeth, your jaw or other areas, your dentist will likely prescribe antibiotics to stop it from spreading further. He or she may also recommend antibiotics if you have a weakened immune system.",

        "overview": "Rosacea is a skin condition that affects the face. It is not contagious, but it is very common: in the United Kingdom, for example, about one in 10 adults are affected, and, according to recent statistics, over 16 million Americans.Rosacea is not a type of acne, and the term acne rosacea is misleading. However, acne and rosacea may occur together. Unlike acne, rosacea is more common among older people, particularly those aged between 40 and 60 years of age. It is somewhat more common among women than men, but tends to be more severe in men. Also, unlike acne, rosacea does not cause scarring. Rosacea usually affects the skin of the face, particularly the nose, cheeks and forehead. In some cases, it can affect the skin of the neck, chest and ears, and rarely, it can affect the eye. Rosacea is not always itchy or painful, but may cause a stinging or burning sensation. It can also be unsightly and distressing to those affected by it. Its most prominent symptoms are facial redness and flushing. A rare effect of rosacea is rhinophyma, a thickening of the skin on and around the nose that leads to a characteristic red and bumpy appearance. This is usually found in older male sufferers.There are several subtypes of rosacea:Treatment depends on which sort of rosacea is present. People suspected of having rosacea, particularly those who suffer from ocular rosacea or from symptoms that are resistant to treatment, should generally be treated by a specialist such as a dermatologist or ophthalmologist.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "Although there is currently no total cure for rosacea, there are many treatment options. Treatment may need to be long-term, but it is easily manageable and very effective. Treatment for rosacea is mainly concerned with reducing inflammation and managing sensitive skin. Treatment options include topical creams and ointments, oral medications, and lifestyle changes. People with this condition may find that some treatments, or combinations of treatments, work better for them than others do. Topical medication: creams and ointments Topical preparations, which are applied to the skin rather than taken orally, can help rosacea sufferers lessen the redness and inflammation they experience. Commonly-prescribed topical rosacea treatments include: Brimonidine cream Azelaic acid cream Sodium sulfacetamide-sulfur cream Doxycycline ointment Metronidazole cream Some rosacea sufferers find that applying jojoba oil is helpful. However, people with rosacea should never use acne preparations and should avoid topical corticosteroids, unless they are specifically prescribed by a specialist. While topical steroid preparations are helpful in reducing inflammation in the short term, in the long term they can make the problem worse.In cases where the rosacea is mild, it may be possible to manage it with only topical creams and lifestyle changes. In cases of severe rosacea, laser and light treatments are an option for the treatment of redness, inflammation, pustules and rhinophyma. Nonablative lasers that do not destroy tissue, in the 500 to 600 nanometer (nm) range, and long-pulsed pulse dye lasers, as well as 532nm potassium-titanyl-phosphate lasers can help alleviate rosacea symptoms. Intense pulsed-light devices in the 515 to 1200nm range are another option. Phymatous rosacea, which causes thickening of the skin and may cause rhinophyma, can be treated with ablative lasers that destroy tissue, such as erbium or CO2 lasers. The object of this treatment is to remove the overgrowth of tissue from the area.Oral medicationIn severe cases, some people with rosacea find that a course of oral antibiotics helps reduce inflammation. This is true even though it is not known whether there are any particular bacteria involved in causing rosacea. Oral antibiotics that are sometimes used to treat rosacea include the tetracycline class: Tetracycline Oxytetracycline Doxycycline Lymecycline Minocycline A course of 40mg of oral doxycycline daily is often effective. If doxycycline is not an option, 100mg of oral minocycline daily has been found to be effective as well.Other oral medications include: Erythromycin Trimethoprim Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole Ampicillin Clindamycin Dapsone Blushing and redness may also be managed by beta-blockers or clonidine. Very severe rosacea, especially phymatous rosacea that may lead to rhinophyma, or thickening of the skin, may respond well to isotretinoin. The length of time for which an individual may have to take antibiotics depends on how severe their rosacea is and how well they respond to antibiotic treatment. However, it is important that all courses of antibiotics prescribed for rosacea are completed in order to assess whether they were effective.In most cases, improvement can be expected within two to three weeks of beginning a course of antibiotics, but it may take several months to completely clear up symptoms such as papules and pustules. Moreover, pustules and papules may return when the antibiotic course is over. If this happens, a longer-term course of maintenance doses of antibiotics might be effective.Antibiotics can have serious side effects, so the use of oral antibiotic treatments should only be considered when topical treatments and lifestyle changes have proved to be ineffective in reducing severe rosacea.Management of ocular rosaceaOcular rosacea affects the eyes rather than the skin, and so the treatment program is quite different in some ways. It may cause inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), which is painful and may increase the risk of infection. Styes, cysts and chalazions may also occur.The first line of treatment for ocular rosacea is to improve eyelid hygiene. This is done by using: Artificial tears to moisten and lubricate the eye, and reduce irritation. Care should be taken to use only eye drops that mimic natural tears. Never touch the surface of the eyeball or eyelid with the nozzle of the bottle. A warm compress, using a clean cloth soaked with very warm water held against each eye for five to 10 minutes. The cloth should be remoistened with warm water regularly. This reduces inflammation, cleans the eyelid and provides relief from stinging. To remove irritants such as dust, grit and secretions from the eyelid and eyelashes, wipes with a physiological salt solution, i.e.one that mimics the eyes natural moisture, can be used. Pharmacists can help if necessary. Thereafter, antibiotics in several forms may be used: Topical antibiotic creams, gels or drops containing ciclosporin or metronidazole Oral antibiotics such as azithromycin or a tetracyline A course of oral oxytetracycline followed by an eight-week course of topical metronidazole has been found to alleviate symptoms.. Otherwise, oral tetracyline taken once daily, along with topical ivermectin and/or azelaic acid, may be helpful.People with ocular rosacea or irritated eyes as a result of rosacea should avoid eye makeup, rubbing their eyes and taking Omega 3 supplements. Wearing contact lenses may be uncomfortable with inflamed eyes.Home managementAside from using prescription antibiotics, people with rosacea can take easy steps at home to get relief from the discomfort of rosacea and the appearance of symptoms. For many people, this involves, learning to avoid triggers and removing irritants from their care regimes.Cleansing and skincareGenerally, people with rosacea will find it helpful to avoid getting sunburned. If exposure to strong sunlight cannot be avoided, a strong sunblock should be used with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or more, as well as UVB and UVA protection.People with rosacea who regularly shave their faces, should switch from a traditional bladed razor to an electric razor. Electric razors do not come into such tight contact with the skin and are therefore less irritating.Cleansers used by people with rosacea should not contain abrasives, including organic abrasives such as crushed apricot kernels, alcohol or acetone. Perfumed soaps, moisturisers and washes should be avoided. Oil-based or waterproof makeup should be avoided. Insect-repellent facial moisturisers or sunblock should not be used.Hypoallergenic, non-greasy, non-perfumed emollient preparations can be used. Over-the-counter acne preparations are not helpful to people with rosacea. They may make the symptoms worse and should be avoided.Lifestyle changesPeople with rosacea, who smoke tobacco cigarettes or regularly consume alcohol, may find it useful to cut back their consumption. Smoking dries the skin, while alcohol widens blood vessels and therefore worsens the redness of skin.As stress is known to make rosacea symptoms worse, learning to manage stressful situations and general life stress is recommended by many rosacea groups, such as the International Rosacea Foundation and the National Rosacea Society.Weight management can assist in the alleviation of redness, while maintaining good hydration by drinking enough water is believed to help lessen the redness and inflammation characteristic of rosacea. A diet low in processed carbohydrates may also be helpful in some cases, as carbohydrates cause blood glucose to increase, which can lead to vasodilation and thus redness.In people who have severe rosacea, or feel that the appearance of their symptoms is negatively impacting their quality of life, learning to apply camouflage makeup may be helpful. Many regional health communities can arrange access to camouflage makeup tutorials and workshops.",

Many people with rotator cuff disease can manage their symptoms and return to activities with physical therapy exercises that improve flexibility and strength of the muscles surrounding the shoulder joint. Sometimes, rotator cuff tears may occur as a result of a single injury. In those circumstances, medical evaluation should be provided as soon as possible to discuss the role of surgery.

Stress incontinence is not related to psychological stress. Stress incontinence is different from urgency incontinence and overactive bladder (OAB). If you have urgency incontinence or OAB, your bladder muscle contracts, causing a sudden urge to urinate before you can get to the bathroom. Stress incontinence is much more common in women than in men. If you have stress incontinence, you may feel embarrassed, isolate yourself, or limit your work and social life.

        "overview": "A tension-type headache, or tension headache, is the most commonly experienced type of headache. It is a primary form of headache, meaning it is caused by no underlying medical condition. Tension headaches can be both episodic and chronic. Episodic tension headaches occur on fewer than half the days of a month. Chronic tension headaches occur on half the days of a month or more for three months or more consecutively. This type of headache will typically have a duration of 30 minutes to several hours, but can on occasion last for a number of days.Although they can be uncomfortable, a tension headache will not typically be severe enough to interfere with day-to-day activities and will not normally require specialist medical attention.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "In most cases, treatment for tension headaches involves a combination of lifestyle changes and pain relieving medication. Painkillers can often be effective in treating tension headaches. It should be noted, however, that painkillers should not be used for more than a couple of days at a time. This can lead to medication-overuse headaches. If chronic tension headaches are being experienced, a doctor will be able to advise on suitable treatment options. The most common pain relief medication prescribed to treat tension headaches include: Paracetamol: Available over the counter from pharmacies and other stores, paracetamol can be effective in relieving the pain of a tension headache. It is most effective when taken as soon as the headache develops and a second dose can be taken after around four hours. Anti-inflammatory medication: Some types of anti-inflammatory medications, such as Ibuprofen, are available over the counter. Others require a prescription, such as naproxen. They can be effective in relieving pain, but may in some cases lead to side-effects such as stomach problems. Aspirin: They can be effective in relieving pain but may lead to stomach-related side effects. For this reason, some doctors will not advise the use of aspirin. Before using any form of medication, the patient information leaflet accompanying it should be read in full and its instructions followed. Combining different forms of medication is generally not advised. During the headache episode itself, certain relaxation techniques can aid a speedy recovery and help reduce pain. These include: Hydration: Drinking plenty of water throughout the day can help ease the pain. Room temperature water is the best option, because ice-cold water can cause headaches in some people. Relaxation: Getting plenty of rest and lying or sitting in a comfortable position can help a headache pass quickly. Creating a quiet, dark environment by drawing the curtains/blinds or wearing an eye mask can also help, because in some people light makes headaches worse. Breathing and muscle relaxation exercises: Deep breathing exercises can help relax the body, easing the tension related to a headache. Likewise, muscle relaxation exercises can help to reduce tension and pressure in the head and neck area. Doctors will be able to recommend a variety of techniques to practice during a headache. Light exercise: For tension headaches, non-intensive exercise activities, such as yoga, walking or relaxed cycling can help alleviate the headache symptoms. If the weather is fine, these gentle exercise activities, can ideally be carried out outdoors, in order to breathe in fresh air.",

Fibroids range in size from seedlings, undetectable by the human eye, to bulky masses that can distort and enlarge the uterus. You can have a single fibroid or multiple ones. In extreme cases, multiple fibroids can expand the uterus so much that it reaches the rib cage and can add weight. Many women have uterine fibroids sometime during their lives. But you might not know you have uterine fibroids because they often cause no symptoms. Your doctor may discover fibroids incidentally during a pelvic exam or prenatal ultrasound.",

A varicocele is similar to a varicose vein you might see in your leg. Varicoceles are a common cause of low sperm production and decreased sperm quality, which can cause infertility. However, not all varicoceles affect sperm production. Varicoceles can also cause testicles to fail to develop normally or shrink. Most varicoceles develop over time. Fortunately, most varicoceles are easy to diagnose and many don't need treatment. If a varicocele causes symptoms, it often can be repaired surgically.",

However, if your varicocele causes pain, testicular atrophy or infertility or if you are considering assisted reproductive techniques, you might want to undergo varicocele repair. The purpose of surgery is to seal off the affected vein to redirect the blood flow into normal veins. In cases of male infertility, treatment of a varicocele might improve or cure the infertility or improve the quality of sperm if techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) are to be used. Clear indications to repair a varicocele in adolescence include progressive testicular atrophy, pain or abnormal semen analysis results. Although treatment of a varicocele generally improves sperm characteristics, it's not clear if an untreated varicocele leads to progressive worsening of sperm quality over time.",

        "overview": "Viral gastroenteritis is a type of gastroenteritis a common condition sometimes called stomach flu or food poisoning. Gastroenteritis is the result of irritation and inflammation in the stomach and intestines. It can be caused by infection with a virus such as rotavirus, bacteria or parasites, among other things. When caused by a virus, it is called viral gastroenteritis. While it can be very unpleasant, most cases of viral gastroenteritis can be treated at home, and clear up within a few days without causing complications. Symptoms of viral gastroenteritis can range from mild to severe and vary among people. However, the main symptoms are typically vomiting and mild fever, which develop quickly, followed by watery diarrhea for a few days. Viral gastroenteritis can be caused by a number of different types of viruses, including rotavirus, norovirus and adenovirus. The viruses can be transmitted direct from one person to another or spread through contaminated food and water. Depending on the source of infection, a large group of people may develop viral gastroenteritis at the same time, e.g. an outbreak on a cruise ship or at a summer camp. Treatment for viral gastroenteritis typically involves: In some cases, when a person is not able to keep fluids down and is becoming dehydrated, replacement of fluids through an intravenous (IV) drip at a hospital may be necessary. Antibiotics are not helpful for viral gastroenteritis. Generally, people make a full recovery, and a bout of viral gastroenteritis does not cause any complications. However, if it occurs in a person with a weakened immune system, someone who is pregnant, very young or elderly, or someone with a chronic condition such as diabetes, viral gastroenteritis can be serious, and medical advice should be sought without delay. In addition, anyone experiencing severe symptoms should see a doctor immediately. Furthermore, if symptoms are mild but do not improve within a few days, or where a person has recently returned from travel abroad, medical advice should be sought. Viral gastroenteritis can affect adults and children (see pediatric viral gastroenteritis) of all ages. It is very contagious and can be spread easily. For this reason, it is important for people who have viral gastroenteritis to take steps to avoid passing it on to others, such as practicing good personal hygiene and avoiding the preparation of food for other people.",
        "treatment": {
            "outline": "Most cases of viral gastroenteritis clear up without specific medical treatment. As long as symptoms are not severe and there are no signs of dehydration, a person can generally treat viral gastroenteritis in an adult or child at home.Home remediesThe following home remedies and over-the-counter treatment approaches are recommended for mild cases of viral gastroenteritis: Bed rest Consuming plenty of fluids in the form of water or oral rehydration drinks; at the very least, small sips should be taken between being sick or having bowel movements Eating light meals when appetite returns; plain foods like bread and rice may be helpful Taking an antidiarrheal medication, e.g. loperamide, only when necessary and there is no fever, and no blood or mucus is present in the stool Taking antiemetic (anti-nausea) medication for nausea and vomiting, when necessary Taking probiotics may slightly shorten the duration of diarrhea If a person is unable to keep any fluids down or shows signs of dehydration (see below), they may need to be treated with an IV drip at a hospital.Good to know: Antibiotics are not prescribed for viral gastroenteritis, as they are not effective against viruses. Antibiotics are only effective against bacteria. In a severe case of bacterial gastroenteritis, a course of antibiotics may be recommended.",

Accordingly, only 10 percent of those who contract the virus will develop visible warts. Even if they are unaware of its presence, most sexually active people will contract HPV at some point during their lifetime. It is passed on through skin-to-skin contact, most commonly through oral, vaginal or anal intercourse. Although the warts rarely cause any long-term harm, they are generally considered unsightly and may cause psychological distress.

The direction that treatment will take depends on the amount of warts present, their location and their physical appearance. Some patients will choose to undergo no treatment for genital warts. This option is perfectly safe but will generally prolong the problem. If the patient does opt for treatment, there are a number of different options to explore: Application of antiviral gels or creams. These solutions are marketed in a number of different varieties but are generally applied by the patient themselves over the course of a number of days or weeks. Side-effects may include itching and mild scarring. Cryotherapy (freezing). Liquid nitrogen is used to rapidly freeze the affected area, resulting in a mild burning sensation. This procedure is usually used for small warts around the penis or vulva. Excision. The warts are surgically removed while the patient is under a local anesthetic. Typically used for small, hardened warts. Electrosurgery. Generally used for large clusters of warts that have not responded to other treatments, this option involves cutting away the bulk of the warts, pressing a metal rod against the affected area and sending an electric current through it to burn away what remains. Laser surgery. Generally used for large clusters of warts or those that are difficult to reach (inside the anus, for example). A specialist will use a laser to burn away the mass of warts while the patient is under regional or general anaesthetic.",
